# LC_biomarkers_Validation
This repository contains the scripts used for the external validation of predictive models described in the manuscript "Recommendations for validating omics prediction models: Insights from a lung cancer RNA biomarker study".

Run the "LC_biomarkers_validation_main.R" script which will automatically import the functions included in "LC_biomarkers_validation_functions.R".
